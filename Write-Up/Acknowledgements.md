# Acknowledgements

Resources for this project include the [Xeno-canto Project](https://xeno-canto.org), as well as the individual recordists for each recording used. Information regarding the recordings and recordist can be found in the included "recordists.csv" file.

Additionally, I made use of the [xeno-canto-py](https://github.com/ntivirikin/xeno-canto-py) project, whose work I have modified in order to filter the recordings and access the Xeno-canto API. The xeno-canto-py project was released under the MIT license.
