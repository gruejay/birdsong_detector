# Bird Song ID 

The goal of this project is to identify species of oscine passerines (Passerine Passeri), also known as songbirds, by their songs. Care must to taken to select species that have distinct enough songs to be readily identifiable. Some oscines, such as crows, do not have distinctive songs despite being songbirds. For the purpose of this project, I am hand selecting a subset of species as candidates for learning based on their song characteristics. This list will be further refined during the data prep portion of the project in order to ensure each species has an adequate number of samples on which the model can be trained.
